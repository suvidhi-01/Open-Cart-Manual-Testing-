# Open-Cart-Manual-Testing-
In this project, I explored the rich functionalities of OpenCart(Frontend) application, an open-source e-commerce platform. From managing products to handling checkout processes, I dove deep into understanding how everything works together to create a smooth shopping experienceâ€”all through hands-on, manual testing.

Key Activities:

ðŸ”¹ Test Scenario Creation â€“ I carefully designed test scenarios to map out different user journeys and interactions. Each scenario was thoughtfully planned to ensure that all critical functionalities of the platform were tested.

ðŸ”¹ Test Case Development â€“ After outlining the scenarios, I broke them down into detailed step-by-step test cases. This helped ensure that every important aspectâ€”like user authentication, product searches, and order processingâ€”was thoroughly checked.

ðŸ”¹ Test Case Execution â€“ I navigated through the OpenCart platform, simulating real user interactions to identify any defects, inconsistencies, or usability issues. This hands-on approach helped me understand the system from a user's perspective.


Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in e-commerce testing methodologies. I developed a strong understanding of how OpenCart works, improved my ability to design effective test cases, and refined my manual testing skills. Additionally, I improved my bug reporting capabilities and learned to utilize bug tracking tools for effective defect management.
